Skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and other Anthropic-API-based agents.

## Skills in this repo

### `coding-standards`

Language-agnostic clean-code rules **plus** per-framework structure rules.

**Universal rules** (`skills/coding-standards/references/common/`):
- `functions.md` — size, argument count, side effects, command/query separation, idiomatic failure handling per language
- `naming.md` — intention-revealing, no Hungarian, meaningful distinctions, pronounceable, searchable, no mental mapping, one word per concept, solution-vs-problem domain names
- `objects-and-data.md` — expose behavior not data, objects vs data structures, sum-type escape hatch, Law of Demeter, no hybrid classes (with framework-boundary carve-out)
- `formatting.md` — newspaper rule, vertical spacing, declarations close to use, line-length convention
- `comments.md` — no narration, comments say *why* not *what*, no redundant docstrings/banners, no filler or change-narration (review-only)
- `error-handling.md` — separate algorithm from error handling, translate at boundaries (exceptions & Result/Either), async failure rules
- `code-principles.md` — SOLID, KISS, DRY
- `structure.md` — universal structural rules: folder-as-module, no deep imports, Rule of Three, no junk-drawer files, generic names at the design system

**Per-framework structure rules** (`skills/coding-standards/references/<framework>/structure.md`):

*Frontend / mobile*
- `nextjs/` — Screaming Architecture + mandatory nesting (App Router)
- `vue-nuxt/` — Flat business folders for Vue 3 / Nuxt 3 (Composition API, Pinia, composables)
- `react-native/` — Flat business folders with ESLint-enforced boundaries (Expo + bare RN)
- `nativescript/` — Flat business folders with MVVM trio per page
- `cocos-creator/` — Asset Bundles per feature (2.x and 3.x, TypeScript)

*Backend*
- `nestjs/` — Package by feature, module per feature
- `node-express/` — Package by feature for plain Node backends
- `laravel/` — Stock Laravel skeleton with capability subfolders inside each layer
- `csharp/` — Single project, flat business folders (vertical-slice flavoured)
- `spring-boot/` — Package by feature with Spring DI and Jakarta validation (Java/Kotlin)
- `django/` — Django apps as capabilities, with an added services layer
- `fastapi/` — Package by feature with APIRouter, Pydantic schemas, async-first
- `flask/` — Application factory + Blueprints per feature
- `go-http/` — `cmd/` + `internal/<feature>` with errors-as-values and consumer-defined interfaces

*Frameworkless*
- `vanilla-js/` — Folder-as-module + co-location (libraries, CLIs, frameworkless apps)

The agent loads `common/` (all eight files) plus the matching framework `structure.md` on every code-writing or review task.

### `writing-standards`

The companion to `coding-standards`: that one governs code, this one governs **documents** — READMEs, specs, rules, skills, design docs, guides, reviews.

Two rule sets (`skills/writing-standards/references/common/`):
- `source-to-deliverable.md` (SD-*) — turn a *source* into a deliverable without echoing it: code→doc describes what the system does, with no code or code-identifiers; discussion→rule states the general principle, not the specific example just discussed.
- `anti-slop.md` (SL-*) — the patterns that read as machine-padded filler (hedging, hype words, throat-clearing, cheerleading, reflexive formatting, padding), each with a fix.

It does **not** block at write time — a document isn't a single Write the way a function is. Instead its bootstrap wires two hooks that inject a short reminder of the rules into the session: `SessionStart` at boot and `UserPromptSubmit` on every prompt, so the rules don't fade as the conversation grows. The full rules are read from `references/common/` when a document is actually written. The hook is stdlib-only — no dependency install, no venv. Wire it with `python3 skills/writing-standards/bootstrap.py` (or it auto-wires on first activation, like `coding-standards`); restart the session once.

## How the skill picks a framework

`SKILL.md` Step 3 has the authoritative detection table (per-framework signals plus the file types each framework owns) — see it for the exact rules rather than relying on examples here, which drift. The shape: each row pairs a framework with repo signals (config files, dependency keys, distinctive file types). Matching is **file-type-aware** — a row only wins if it owns the extension of the file being edited, so a `.php` file in a Laravel + Inertia/Vue repo resolves to `laravel` while a `.vue` in the same repo resolves to `vue-nuxt`. In monorepos the agent picks per file, not per repo. When signals are missing, it asks rather than guesses.

A framework the skill **recognizes but has no structure reference for** (Angular, Svelte/SvelteKit, Astro, Remix, …) is declined explicitly: the agent says so, applies the universal `common/` rules (still enforced by the language hooks on Claude Code, guidance elsewhere — see [enforcement per agent](#what-enforcement-means-per-agent)), and keeps the project's existing layout — it does **not** fall back to the vanilla-js business-folder/barrel layout, which would fight those frameworks' own conventions.

## Installation

### 1. Install the skill via the `skills` CLI

```bash
# Project scope (committed with your project, shared with team)
npx skills add willey-labs/agent-skills

# Global scope (available across all projects)
npx skills add willey-labs/agent-skills -g
```

The `skills` CLI auto-detects which agents you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor,
Codex, OpenCode, and 50+ more); pass `-a claude-code` to target one explicitly.
Installation reaches all of them; write-time **blocking** does not — that part is
Claude Code only (see [the enforcement note](#what-enforcement-means-per-agent)
below). On every other agent the rules ride along as guidance, not a hard block.

Preview before installing: `npx skills add willey-labs/agent-skills --list`.

### 2. Hooks auto-wire on first use — no extra step

The first time the `coding-standards` skill activates in a session (e.g.
you ask Claude Code to "write a component" or "review this PR"), Step 0
of the skill runs `bootstrap.py`. That script:

1. Detects the install scope from its own path (`~/.claude/skills/` → global,
   `<project>/.claude/skills/` → project) and targets the correct
   `settings.json`.
2. Adds a single PreToolUse entry registering all 11 enforcement hooks
   (1 path-checker, 6 language content-checkers, 1 cross-language swallowed-error
   checker, 1 cross-language debug-artifact checker, 1 ST-008 god-file checker that
   blocks on declaration count and advises on size, 1 checker that keeps
   `.coding-standards-structure` to placement only). Existing unrelated `PreToolUse`
   entries and other settings are preserved byte-for-byte.
3. Is idempotent: re-running is a noop unless the skill was upgraded, in
   which case the entry is replaced with the new hook list.

After the first run you'll see something like:

```
coding-standards: Wired 11 PreToolUse hooks into /path/.claude/settings.json (project).
```

**Restart the agent session once** for Claude Code to pick up the new
hooks. From the next session on, the language-aware enforcement (`any`,
Hungarian, 4+ argument functions, junk-drawer paths, deep imports, etc.)
runs on every Write/Edit/MultiEdit automatically.

See `skills/coding-standards/hooks/README.md` for what each hook catches
per language.

#### What enforcement means per agent

> **Distribution is not enforcement.** The skill *installs* on 50+ agents; the
> hard, can't-ignore **write-time block** runs on far fewer. Two tiers:
>
> - **Hard block (Claude Code).** The hooks implement Claude Code's PreToolUse
>   exit-2 + stderr contract. A Write/Edit that violates a rule is stopped before it
>   lands and the agent must fix it. Any agent
>   that implements *that exact* contract would block the same way; today that's
>   Claude Code.
> - **Guidance everywhere else (Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Cline, …).** The skill
>   still installs and the rules still ride along — the model reads them and is
>   expected to follow them — but **nothing blocks a violation at write time.** If
>   the model drifts, the code is written anyway. Cline is a concrete example of why
>   the scripts don't port for free: its hooks expect a JSON `{"cancel": true}` on
>   stdout, not exit 2, so these scripts won't block under it as-is.
>
> So: the *standards* reach every agent; the *hard block* reaches Claude Code. If
> you need the block on another agent, you'd have to implement that agent's own hook
> contract — it isn't shipped here. For a code review pass on any agent, run
> `hooks/review-files.py` as a manual linter (it reports; it doesn't block).

### Manual install (no CLI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willey-labs/agent-skills.git ~/projects/willey-labs/agent-skills
ln -s ~/projects/willey-labs/agent-skills/skills/coding-standards ~/.claude/skills/coding-standards
python3 ~/.claude/skills/coding-standards/bootstrap.py
```

The bootstrap script handles the hook wiring; restart the agent after
the first successful run.

### Updating

To move to a newer version, update the files the normal way:

```bash
# CLI install — re-run to pull the latest
npx skills add willey-labs/agent-skills

# Manual / git install
git -C ~/projects/willey-labs/agent-skills pull
```

You **don't** need to re-run anything by hand, or tell your team to. `bootstrap.py`
is idempotent, and the skill re-runs it on activation (`SKILL.md` Step 0 — "after a
skill update"), so the next session picks up any new hooks **and** re-applies the
permission allow-rules (reading the skill's references and running its scripts
without a prompt). Because settings are read at session start, the *first* session
after an update may still prompt once; the next session is clean. To apply
immediately instead of waiting, run `python3 <skill-dir>/bootstrap.py` and restart.

### Turning it off

Enforcement is always-on once wired — there is no rule toggle (toggles are blocked by design). To disable it, remove the skill's `PreToolUse` entry from the relevant `settings.json` (project or `~/.claude`), or uninstall the skill; for a single path or legacy file, add it to `.coding-standards-ignore` with a `# reason:`. Details in `skills/coding-standards/references/bootstrap.md`.

## Status

The structure rules have been self-reviewed against representative project
layouts. Eleven PreToolUse hooks (one universal path-checker, six language
content-checkers, one cross-language swallowed-error checker, one cross-language
debug-artifact checker, one ST-008 god-file checker that blocks on declaration
count and advises on size, and one checker that keeps `.coding-standards-structure`
to placement only) in `skills/coding-standards/hooks/` enforce what they can detect
reliably. That write-time blocking is **Claude Code only** (the exit-2 PreToolUse
contract); on every other agent the same checks ship as guidance, not a hard block —
see [What enforcement means per agent](#what-enforcement-means-per-agent).
The regex checks hard-block `any`/`Any`/`interface{}`/`dynamic`/`mixed` (OD-006),
Hungarian notation, 4+/5+ argument functions (the line follows the language —
positional vs named-argument — with framework carve-outs for DI constructors,
records, and parameter bindings), swallowed errors (empty `catch`, `except: pass`,
discarded `err` — EH-002), debug residue (`debugger`, `breakpoint()`, `dd()` —
FMT-005, with `console.log`/`print` advised), junk-drawer paths and folders,
dot/star imports, deep imports, and parent traversal. On TypeScript/JavaScript (via tree-sitter) and Python (via the stdlib
`ast`), an AST layer additionally hard-blocks the structural rules a real parse is
needed for: FN-001 (function body length), FN-005 (precise argument count), and
OD-004 (hybrid classes). The advisory hook warns — never blocks — on god-file size
and flat-folder growth. Review treats every finding as a violation to fix — there
are no severity tiers. Everything else relies on the agent reading the references
and applying judgement during write/review. For mechanical checks beyond these (dead code, complexity
metrics, etc.), pair with your project's linter (ESLint, PHPStan, Roslyn
analyzers, etc.).
